Assignment: Hello World
Objectives
Practice the different ways to concatenate and print strings
Practice running a Python file
It's time to start creating Python files! As a rite of passage, 
our first program needs to be Hello World :). 
Let’s practice string concatenation. 
Copy the code below, replacing each of the your code here 
placeholders with the appropriate values. 
Hopefully it's not too patronizing that every other task below is 
running the file--this is just a friendly reminder to get into the habit 
of testing your code regularly!

# 1. TASK: print "Hello World"
print( your code here )
# 2. print "Hello Noelle!" with the name in a variable
name = "Noelle"
print( your code here )	# with a comma
print( your code here )	# with a +
# 3. print "Hello 42!" with the number in a variable
name = 42
print( your code here )	# with a comma
print( your code here )	# with a +	-- this one should give us an error!
# 4. print "I love to eat sushi and pizza." with the foods in variables
fave_food1 = "sushi"
fave_food2 = "pizza"
print( your code here ) # with .format()
print( your code here ) # with an f string
 Create a new Python file called hello_world.py
 Write the code to print a literal string saying "Hello World" (#1)
 Run the file
 Store your name in a variable, and then use it to print the string “Hello {{your name}}!” using a comma in the print function (#2a)
 Run the file
 Store your name in a variable, and then use it to print the string “Hello {{your name}}!” using a + in the print function (#2b)
 Run the file
 Store your favorite number in a variable, and then use it to print the string “Hello {{num}}!” using a comma in the print function (#3a)
 Run the file
 Store your favorite number in a variable, and then use it to print the string “Hello {{num}}!” using a + in the print function (#3b)
 Run the file
 NINJA BONUS: Figure out how to resolve the error from above, without changing the + sign to a comma
 Store 2 of your favorite foods in variables, and then use them to print the string “I love to eat {{food_one}} and {{food_two}}.” with the format method (#4a)
 Run the file
 Store 2 of your favorite foods in variables, and then use them to print the string “I love to eat {{food_one}} and {{food_two}}.” with f-strings (#4b)
 Run the file
 NINJA BONUS: Spend a few minutes playing around with other string methods to see what’s out there!
